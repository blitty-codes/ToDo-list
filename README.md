This project **is a kind of Neumorphism TODO list** done with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

+ ## Use the Web
You can use the web the times you want, for that, just go to https://todos-site.netlify.app/ and you can use it!

+ ### Problems (past)
I am having a problem with gh-pages since it is not working for me, but Netlify is going Ok!
Before that the builds from the Web didn't worked, after asking, there were some changins and it all worked well!
